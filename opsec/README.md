# OPSEC – Automation & Baseline Strategy

This directory defines the **OPSEC core logic** behind this repository.

It contains:
- A clean OPSEC baseline
- Domain classification files
- Automation scripts for periodic review
- Generated reports (not versioned by default)

The goal is to make OPSEC:
- Measurable
- Repeatable
- Auditable over time

## 🧱 Baseline (baseline/)

This folder defines the clean OPSEC baseline.

- `baseline-roots.txt`

Trusted root domains required for:

- System stability

- Connectivity checks

- Core service operation

These domains should never be blocked.

- `denylist.txt`

High-confidence domains associated with:

- Telemetry

- Analytics

- Advertising infrastructure

Used as the primary input for DNS blocking analysis.

- `phantom-tlds.txt`

TLDs commonly associated with:

- Malware

- Phishing

- Disposable infrastructure

- Abuse-heavy domains

Used to evaluate the risk/value ratio of TLD-level blocking.

Blocking a TLD should always be justified by metrics, not assumptions.

## ⚙️ Automation (scripts/)
- `opsec_review.py`

Automation script intended to:

- Analyze DNS logs

- Identify new domains

- Measure blocked vs allowed ratios

- Detect anomalies over time

Designed to be executed periodically (monthly or quarterly).

## 📊 Reports (reports/)

This directory stores generated outputs such as:

- Monthly OPSEC reviews

- Domain statistics

- Trend comparisons

Reports are intentionally excluded from version control by default
to avoid leaking personal DNS data.

## 🔎 Case Studies (case-studies/)

Real-world findings produced by applying this repository's OPSEC methodology — domain investigation, DNS pattern analysis, and detection cross-verification — to threats encountered in the wild.

Each entry documents the indicator of compromise, cross-verification across multiple detection sources, OSINT correlation, and the responsible disclosure process followed when applicable.

Unlike `reports/`, this directory *is* version-controlled — findings here are anonymized and IoCs are defanged before publication, so there's no personal DNS data to leak.

## 🧠 OPSEC Philosophy

This repository follows a baseline-first approach:

- Define what must work

- Reduce noise incrementally

- Measure before hardening further

- Prioritize stability over maximal blocking

Absolute blocking is not OPSEC.
Controlled reduction is.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for:

- Personal security

- Educational purposes

- Research and experimentation

Do not use this tooling to:

- Evade lawful monitoring

- Interfere with networks you don’t control

- Violate local regulations

## 🔐 Final Note

OPSEC is not static.
Baselines must evolve as systems, apps, and threat models change.

Automate review.
Document decisions.
Stay adaptable.
