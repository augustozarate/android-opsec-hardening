## TLD-Level Blocking Strategy

### Globally blocked TLDs
.xyz, .top, .gq, .ml, .cf, .tk

Rationale:
High abuse rate, negligible legitimate usage in mobile ecosystems.

### Profile-based blocked TLDs (Public Wi-Fi)
.click, .link, .review

Rationale:
Mixed-use TLDs, blocked only in high-risk network environments.

### Excluded TLDs
.download, .loan

Rationale:
Documented breakage and legitimate service impact.
