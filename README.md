# Android OPSEC Hardening (Hybrid DNS Model)

This project documents a real-world OPSEC hardening strategy applied to an Android
device using DNS-level filtering (NextDNS) combined with a VPN.

The objective is to reduce telemetry, tracking and DNS noise while preserving system
stability and usability, including essential services and major social platforms.

## Key Topics
- DNS noise reduction
- Hybrid allow/block strategy
- VPN + DNS coexistence
- Android system stability
- Public Wi-Fi threat mitigation
